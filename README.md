# pads
For educational purposes, when creating OTP sheets for "Dein Star" and the "Diana Cryptosystem".

Do not use the first group, on a pad, for encryption. Leave the first group as it is,
so that the receiver, of the encrypted message, knows what pad was used.

To not send accidentially messages simultaneously with the same pads, you need to print out the pads as 'in.txt' and 'out.txt', i.e pad 1 of 'out', from the sender, is the same as pad 1 of 'in' from the receiver, vice versa, and so on.
